# Solid Design Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

1. A class or module should only have one reason to change.
2. e.g. multiselect module should only have multiselect related functionality.

## Open Closed Priniciple:

- Open for extension and closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle:
- Objects of superclass should be replacable with objects of sub class without affecting the correctness of the program.
