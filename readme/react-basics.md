### React
React Features:
1. **Declarative:** Describes how components look like and how thet work using **JSX** Syntax.
2. React is abstarction away from **DOM** , we never touch the DOM, as it bypasses React's virtual DOM and can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, using this approach can result in inefficient rendering and make it harder to manage component state effectively.
